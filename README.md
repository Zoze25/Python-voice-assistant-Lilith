# Python-voice-assistant-Lilith
Hello World! This is my college thesis written in Python. Please don't judge strictly, I'm just a beginner in IT.

Attention! This program is made in Russian because it is my main language.
In the .bat files I wrote the path to the Microsoft Office executable files, and the voice folder stores playback files in a single-threaded format to avoid bugs with drivers and reduce their weight.
I voiced them through a third-party library.

I also want to warn you right away that all audio files are played through a separate audio player ffmpeg which I personally had the path C:\ffmpeg
